cleaned data also stored in to DB as master table 
1.  warning critical down and 
    up & available 
2. using  warning critical down we create 3 KEDB tload this data in DB as 3 tables


3. Also load ivanthi data  and clean that  also we add this to out master ivanthi table 

4. using this 3 KEDB tables we seach solution on  master ivanthi if solution available we took that solution  use LLM to reprase it else we use LLM to have a Solution 
and update the same in the 3 KEDB table



infrense from user

prompts
user ask question 
collect ans from 3 DBs 
 and create meaningful ans it by NLTK



What will do  on  Warning  state
which device?
 due to member status on Intertec Perimter FW01?


What is the status of status on Intertec Perimter FW0?

I am d=no checking



Data Processing Workflow
Data Cleaning and Storage:

Cleaned data is stored in the database as a master table.
Status categories include:
Warning
Critical
Down
Up & Available
KEDB (Known Error Database) Creation:

Based on the "Warning," "Critical," and "Down" statuses, three KEDB tables are created.
This data is loaded into the database as three separate tables.
Ivanthi Data Integration:

Ivanthi data is cleaned and added to the master Ivanthi table.
Solution Search Process:

Use the three KEDB tables to search for solutions in the master Ivanthi table:
If a solution exists: Use it and rephrase it with a Large Language Model (LLM).
If no solution exists: Use the LLM to generate a solution and update the three KEDB tables with it.
Inference and Response Generation
User Prompts:
When a user asks a question, the system collects answers from the three databases.
A meaningful response is generated using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for language processing.
Example Scenario: Handling a Warning State
Question:
"What will we do in the 'Warning' state? Which device is impacted due to member status on Intertec Perimeter FW01?"

Response Workflow:

Identify the "Warning" state and impacted device in the database.
Search for solutions in the three KEDB tables and the master Ivanthi table.
If a solution is found: Rephrase it using the LLM.
If no solution is found: Generate a new solution with the LLM.
Present the final answer to the user.
